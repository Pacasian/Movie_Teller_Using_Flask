# Movie_Teller_Using_Flask


The project is basically build on Flask. The project can be classified into two modules <br>
-> <b><i>API handling module ,</i></b><br>
-> <b><i>Web Implementation module .</i></b>

## The API Handling Module :

So, here we used the <b>wikipedia api </b> service to get the plot of the story. At first the landing page, the user can search for their desirable movie and this specific text is manipulated and send to wikipedia using associated API's. The response is shown in the <b>contact1.html</b>. At this point the received text is converted to audio using GTTS serive and be displayed using audio tag or IPython
